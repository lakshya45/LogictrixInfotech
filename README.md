### NodeJs project

TASK FOR DEVOPS write code for gitlab yaml to deploy node js code through aws elastic containerservice. And architectural diagram for server less application deployment for e-commerce

To Be Honest the tools i had learn before this placement drive and bit before are devops are docker & dockerhub, chef, jenkins, maven, git &github and also right now I'm learning kubernetes , nagios & ansible . yes i had knowledge of gitlab but as i didn't explore yet much so I'm bit confuse ..yes the syntax and commands are much similar like commit push and pull origin master and also in aws i had know & explore many services like ec2, ebs volume ,s3 , aws lambda, vpc, nat gateway, elasticbeanstalk ,elastic load balancer ,autoscaling ,dynamo db , rds . but as this task i have to done in ecs & ecr so to be very honest i dont know about this services as i had learn docker for container &images and currently learning kubernetes for container management so just explore and get to know basic of these services through internet and done this task so if in future company demand to me to learn new technology & stuff I am ready for it.
also I'm attaching the screenshot of aws and gitlab that i did in task for configuration.
also yes i want to learn gitlab and ecs ,ecr further more as I have curiosity about learning new technology's so that's is the i things i want to say is that they are many tools for devops in market and i learn mention above so whichever tools your company demand in future I'm definitely learn that quickly.
Thank You.
